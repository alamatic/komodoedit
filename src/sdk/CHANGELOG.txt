# v0.3.0

- `koext build` now excludes IDL files from the components directory. The
  IDL files are already being includes in the "idl" directory of the .xpi.
- `koext build` now includes the source UDL files (in the "udl" dir) in an
  extension. This is useful (a) as self-documentation and (b) in case the
  extension is providing UDL library files that other extensions might be
  able to use.
- `koext build` not copies built bits (e.g. "*.xpt" from "*.idl", "*.lexres"
  from "*.idl") into the *source* directory to support working with a
  devinstall.
- Add `koext devinstall` to hookup an extension source dir with a Komodo dev
  build for quick development (don't need to rebuild and reinstall a .xpi).
  Currently this only works in a Komodo development build, but the intention
  is to make this work with a regular Komodo installation as well.
