If you have any questions concerning this, you may contact ActiveState via email.

This ActiveState License ("License") is made between ActiveState Software Inc. ("ActiveState") as licensor, and you, as licensee, as of the date of your use of the Software (the Software is in use on a computer when it is loaded into the RAM or installed into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk or other storage device) of that computer.).

This License reflects ActiveState's intent to retain full ownership of and control of the use and distribution of ActiveState Komodo, the License Key (as hereinafter defined) and other applicable software (collectively the "Software").

   1. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, ActiveState grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited license to use the Software solely to create, compile, test and deploy, in source or object code form, your own application programs ("Works"). You may create redistributable applications based on your unique development work using the Software and you may sublicense to end users of such Works ("End Users") the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to install and execute the files, and/or libraries that are necessary to use the Works created using the Software. Use of such files and/or libraries by such End Users is limited to runtime purposes only. You may not provide any End User with access to the development or interactive capabilities of the Software libraries or technology, nor may you expose the base programming language(s) as a scripting language within the Works to any such End User. When you pay the license fee established by ActiveState, you will receive a license key (the "License Key") from ActiveState that authorizes you to use the Software only in the following specific contexts:

(A "network" is any combination of two or more computers that are electronically linked and capable of sharing the use of a single software program.) You will obtain a separate license for each additional user of the Software (whether or not such users are connected on a network). You are not permitted to sell, lease, distribute, transfer, sublicense, or otherwise dispose of the Software, in whole or in part, for any form of actual or potential commercial gain or consideration.
         2. Evaluation (Trial) Use. If your License Key authorizes Evaluation (Trial) Use you may use the software only for evaluation purposes without payment of the License Fee for a period of no more than twenty-one (21) days from the date of download.
         3. Non-commercial Use. If your License Key authorizes Non-commercial Use, you may use the software in a teaching or learning environment only. You are not permitted to sell, lease, distribute, transfer, sublicense, or otherwise dispose of the Software, in whole or in part, for any form of actual or potential commercial gain or consideration.
         4. Other Use. Any use of the software other than the uses specified above requires a separate license from ActiveState and the payment of additional license fees as determined by ActiveState. Such additional redistribution options are available, at ActiveState�s sole discretion, on a case-by-case basis. Contact Sales@ActiveState to discuss any redistribution options not covered by this license agreement. ActiveState reserves all rights not expressly granted to you herein.
