Known Issues

   To view the status of outstanding Komodo Snapdragon issues, including
   those that have been fixed in this release, or to add comments or
   additional issues, please visit the Komodo Bug Database. Komodo
   Snapdragon inherits the following known issues from Komodo Edit.

Installation & Upgrade

     * When upgrading to a version of Komodo with a new application data
       directory (i.e. 4.0.1 to 4.0.3 or 4.0.3 to 4.1), the usernames and
       passwords for Remote Accounts are not imported. These must be
       re-entered for each Server in the Server Preferences panel after
       the upgrade.
     * Windows Vista will prompt you to either 'Allow' or 'Deny' the
       installation. Click on 'Allow' and Komodo will install normally.
     * The Komodo installer requires up to 230 MB in your TMP directory
       (as indicated by the value of your 'TMP' environment variable)
       during installation, even if you plan to install Komodo to another
       drive. If you do not have the required space on this drive,
       manually set the 'TMP' environment variable to another directory
       with sufficient space. Ensure that you have enough space,
       temporarily, for installation. (Bug 7057)
     * If you try to install Komodo on Windows and the MSI install fails
       with error 2355, your MSI file is corrupt. Please download Komodo
       again and re-run the MSI install. (Bug 7405)

Startup

     * The first time Komodo is run after installation, it must register
       a number of components with the operating system. This causes the
       first launch to be considerably slower than subsequent launches.

Editing

     * SuSE 10.2 users without Gnome installed may encounter a bug which
       prevents text from being entered in editor tabs and other
       scintilla text boxes. As a work-around, installing Gnome (even if
       it is not used as the desktop environment) seems to solve this
       problem. (Bug 70812)
     * The line and column cursor coordinates in the status bar are not
       updated while the cursor is moving.
     * The macro recorder will record events that it cannot handle, such
       as the opening of dialogs. The only dialog that can be opened via
       a macro is the Find dialog; other dialogs will cause the macro to
       stop.
     * Languages that are read right to left and Asian languages are not
       supported. All Latin and Cyrillic languages are fully supported.
       (Bug 29702)
     * On slow networks, users may notice performance degradation when
       editing files on network machines. Performance can be improved by
       disabling the Komodo function that checks if files on disk have
       changed. Use the Editor Preferences to disable this feature. (Bug
       18297)
     * Interpolation shortcuts in snippets are not executed when the
       snippet is inserted in the Editor Pane via dragging and dropping.
     * On Linux, GTK2 hard codes 'Ctrl'+'Shift' to use international
       input. Therefore, all key bindings involving 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+ (any
       valid hexadecimal character} do not work in Komodo. A workaround
       is to start Komodo with the command: export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim;
       ./komodo'. Otherwise, key bindings of this kind must be changed.
       (Bug 38205)
     * When copying text that does not have Windows line endings into
       another application, which expects Windows line endings, the text
       may not retain the desired formatting. The text is often pasted as
       a single line. (Bug 36791)
     * Code snippets that are 8-bit-encoded and contain high-bit
       characters may have the wrong encoding (or no encoding) when
       inserted from the Toolbox into a UTF-8 encoded file in the Editor
       Pane. (Bug 36769)
     * When editing a code comment in Komodo you may use <Shift+Enter> to
       start a new line within the comment -- the comment prefix is added
       automatically. Komodo may fail to properly add the comment prefix
       if many new lines are added quickly with repeated <Shift+Enter>
       presses. (Bug 38658)

Mac OS X

     * If you have two drives with the same name, and you use the file
       open dialog in a mozilla application, the directory menu (top
       middle of dialog) may crash when clicked. To avoid this, rename
       one of the hard drives.
     * New Custom Menus created in a Project or in the Toolbox will not
       appear until Komodo has been restared.
     * Throughout the Komodo documentation there are references to key
       bindings that use the 'Meta' key. This key may be better known to
       OS X users as the 'Command' key. (Bug 41959)
     * Komodo will shut down and restart itself the first time it is run
       after installation. (Bug 40143)
     * Display of text during editing ("painting") may sometimes be slow
       or pause momentarily.
     * Certain UI elements stop working after changing key bindings.
       Restarting Komodo fixes this. (Bug 38683)
     * When saving a file, Komodo does not set file information (type and
       creator) for the OS X Finder to know that Komodo created the file.
       (Bug 38745)
     * Komodo is sometimes recognized as a web browser by some
       applications on OS X (e.g. Safari's "Default Web Browser"
       setting). Using Komodo as the default web browser is not
       recommended.
     * Application menu items that have multi-key key bindings will not
       show their key bindings in a pop-up tool tip on OS X. This is a
       limitation in OS X.
     * Context menus may not display unless you hold down the mouse
       button for a period of time. This is because the Komodo editor is
       implemented in Mozilla as a plugin, and it does not access the
       apropriate context menu event to handle this behaviour properly
       without interfering with other mouse events (for example, drag and
       drop). (Bug 41216)
     * Due to a limitation in the Mozilla code base, key bindings for the
       Next File and Previous File options on the Window menu are not
       displayed next to the menu items. The key bindings are
       'Meta'+'PageDown' to view the next file and 'Meta'+'PageUp' to
       view the previous file. (Bug 40716)

Linux

     * When closing any Komodo window that contains an editor component,
       a GLIB error entry will appear in the log files (or terminal if
       Komodo was started from one). This error can be safely ignored. A
       patch was submitted by the Mozilla group to the Gnome group that
       handles this error, and should be available in GTK 2.4 or higher.
       The patch can be viewed at
       http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128546
       (Bug 33817)
     * The Fonts and Colors pane in the Preferences dialog box displays
       the same list of fonts in both the Fixed and Proportional lists.
       There is no programmatic way to identify whether a font is
       proportional or not on GTK; therefore, users must know the
       properties of the individual fonts when modifying these values.
       (Bug 27206)
     * If the GTK theme is changed while Komodo is running, Komodo will
       not change the menu/toolbar font colors, causing usability
       problems in extreme cases. (Bug 34508)
     * Install Komodo into a directory path that only includes
       alphanumeric characters. Komodo is known to have trouble with
       paths that include spaces and some non-alphanumeric characters.
     * Filenames or paths containing non-ASCII characters cannot be
       opened remotely.
     * Key bindings defined in the window manager (such as KDE) take
       precedence over Komodo key bindings. In the case of conflicts, you
       must either change the Komodo key bindings or the window manager
       key bindings. (Bug 30926)
     * You cannot move an existing Komodo installation to a new
       directory. You must uninstall Komodo from the existing location
       and reinstall it in the new location. (Bug 19478)
     * Red Hat Linux 9.0 is known to have threading library bugs in its
       glibc that may cause Komodo to hang in certain situations. The
       recommended solution is to upgrade to the latest glibc for Red Hat
       Linux 9.0. (Bug 24340)
     * Komodo may not start up correctly on some Linux systems if C++
       compatibility libraries have not been installed. On Fedora and Red
       Hat systems, install the "compat-libstdc++" package. On SuSE,
       install the "compat" package. On Gentoo, as root, run emerge
       lib-compat. This is not thought to be a problem on Debian systems.
       (Bug 36244)
     * Komodo will work on Debian/Ubuntu AMD64 with some manual
       configuration (some libraries were not properly ported to support
       32-bit applications). (Bug 41368) Run Komodo from a shell script
       which sets certain environment variables:
#!/bin/sh
export GTK_PATH=/usr/lib32/gtk-2.0/
export PANGO_RC_FILE=/etc/pango32/pangorc
komodo
       The pangorc file should contain the following:
[Pango]
ModuleFiles=/etc/pango32/pango.modules
[PangoX]
AliasFiles=/etc/pango/pangox.aliases
       More information on running 32 bit Mozilla applications on AMD64
       can be found here.

Other

     * A limitation in the parser used by the DOM Viewer causes HTML
       elements embedded in JavaScript strings to appear as element nodes
       of the current document. Placing the JavaScript in a CDATA section
       or a comment avoids this problem.
     * Komodo inherits a Mozilla bug whereby certain video drivers on
       Windows cause Komodo to crash. If you experience this behavior,
       upgrade your video driver to the latest version. If the problem
       persists, reduce the color definition assigned to the driver
       (Control Panel|Display|Settings). (Bug 32746)
     * Komodo inherits a Mozilla bug regarding display on dual-monitor
       systems where the secondary monitor is to the left of the primary
       monitor (causing negative coordinate results). The Komodo display
       occasionally fails to refresh; Komodo must be stopped and
       restarted to fix the display (Bug 26852)
     * When using Komodo's Preview in Browser feature, users running
       Mozilla on Windows XP Pro, Windows 2000 Pro and Windows 98 may
       find that they cannot exit Komodo if Mozilla is still open. If
       this should occur, close all open browser windows before exiting
       Komodo. (Bug 26431)
     * The Palm Desktop for Windows software makes exclusive use of the
       'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'T' key combination, thus making this combination
       unavailable in Komodo. (Bug 27851)
     * On Windows NT, some interactive commands may not work properly
       when run from the Command Output tab of the Output Pane. You must
       run these commands in a separate shell. (Bug 23176)
     * In file picker dialogs that display a list of files, when "All
       files" is specified, files that begin with a period are not
       displayed (Bug 18712)
     * The Output tab cuts off lines at 250 characters. (Bug 20711)
     * Macros will not record certain commands, including (but possibly
       not limited to) 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'B'|'R'|'E'|'D' (toggle toolbars or
       button text), 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'N' (new default file), and View as
       Language menu items.
     * Users of the Japanese version of Windows XP may experience
       difficulties in starting Komodo.
     * The Open field in the Open/Find Toolbar does not automatically
       display a drop-down list of directories when an UNC path is typed.
       Currently, the list is only displayed when a the path includes a
       subdirectory. (Bug 29011)
     * When adding new key bindings via the Preferences dialog box,
       Komodo displays a message indicating that the key bindings will
       not take effect until Komodo is restarted. However, some changes
       do take effect immediately.(Bug 36710)
     * "Find" macros do not work because incorrect code is recorded. (Bug
       36332)
     * If you rename a folder that was added to a custom menu, the name
       is changed in Komodo's Toolbox but not on the menu itself. A
       workaround is to move the renamed folder out and then back into
       the associated custom menu icon in the Toolbox. (Bug 36679)
     * The Mozilla code base currently does not support the Windows
       Unicode binary. As a result, Komodo for Windows is unable to open
       files or paths that contain character sets that are not in the
       systems locale. (Bug 33304)
     * A newly created custom menu is added to the Toolbox but is not
       immediately displayed alongside existing toolbars. Restarting
       Komodo causes the new toolbar to display. (Bug 40078)
